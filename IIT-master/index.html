				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Born on June 29th 1999, I am currently 21 years old and have just begun a new chapter in my life at RMIT. Fortunately my parents had blessed me with a multi-cultural and unique upbringing, raising me in countries Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia (this is where I picked up motorcycling as a passion).  
					</p>

					<p> Due to my parents both teaching at International Schools, my sister and I were able to attend great PYP/MYP & IB schools. Living abroad for 13 years has immeasurably extended my world-view and convinced me that when/if I have kids of my own I want to make sure they have a similar opportunity. After graduating grade 12 with a decent score I applied to Monash University. Melbourne appeared to be a great choice for me as I had some relatives still living here as well as my older sister who had recently been accepted into Melbourne University. Unfortunately not all things work out and after 2 years at Monash I decided I was not in an appropriate financial nor mental state to be continuing my studies and left just before 2020. After a year locked inside without much to do other than work and reflect on where I want to see my future self, I decided it was time to jump back on the horse and give university another go!</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Painfully it was not until junior and senior year of schooling was I offered any IT related classes (which only consisted of graphic design classes). However my fascination with technology had sparked much earlier. It was actually my interest in weight lifting that introduced me to programming. I had always been a sporty kid (didn’t help my dad was head of P.E wherever we went), joining all the available sport teams however it wasn’t until grade 9-10 when I started lifting weights that my friend Ido introduced me to programming. While I was lifting weights, I was keeping track of numerous values on an excel spreadsheet, including the amount of weight I could lift, my own weight, hours of sleep and protein intake. Ido took notice of me inputting values one afternoon and asked if I knew anything about visual basic. After shaking my head and assuming he was speaking another language he grabbed my laptop and programmed an input box to prompt me to enter my daily values. I was shocked, I thought I was savvy for creating a line graph showing off a positive correlation between my gains and protein intake. I asked him to continue adding more functionality to my simple spreadsheet. By the end of the week my spreadsheet would prompt the user to fill in all relevant values and then add the corresponding values to existing tables, which would consequently update existing charts. Now Ido was too cool to share any of his ‘coding secrets’ but offered to show me some of his work modding our favourite video game at the time: dota 2. I might not of been learning anything specifically but watching Ido edit a page of C# was something I had never seen before. I believe that was the moment I had decided information technology was my path.

					<h2>Project Manager</h2>

					<p>Screenshot is an advertisement from Seek.com.au, it outlines a project management job offering at Reach Agency. My immediate reflex was to check what the job offer paid however very few companies appear to list that outright. Seek does offer an average ball-park figure on what ‘project managers’ appear to be offered however I am not taking this value seriously as it appears to include project managers from multiple industries (namely construction).

				<p>A project manager in my own experience controls the flow and direction of a company's project. Within the IT industry this could be the development of an application or the movement from an outdated system to a new one for example. They achieve this goal through means of planning, risk management and most importantly communication. During a short summer unit at Monash that covered the project management cycle it became apparent that a project manager's value was held in his ability to communicate between employees, stakeholders and users. I am attracted to these relevant positions because of my communication skills. I am a confident public speaker and live for the organisation that project managers must achieve when managing a project.

				</p>
<p> A project manager has to have an understanding of every step in a project's life cycle, this requires said manager to be rather experienced. This particular ad requires 5 years of similar project management work. On top of the 3-4 years of study and years of work experience (as a junior or unrelated role), this line of work is definitely an end-goal for one's career. Specific experience required for this role was outlined with knowledge and experience using various methodologies such as SCRUM, Waterfall and Agile. These methodologies effectively outline the order of tasks. Additionally the manager would be expected to be proficient at various software, such as MS Project, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, JIRA and various Gantt chart softwares.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, the salary for such a position is attractive but I believe it's important not to be caught up in the destination but to instead focus on the journey. Despite not having any experience within the IT industry I have recently been promoted to a leadership role at one of my casual jobs where I have taken over some secretarial roles. This has provided some insight into the management of the business, which I believe is crucial experience for such a role. To fast-track my ability to secure such a role, I am considering an advanced diploma after my bachelors of IT, such as a graduate certificate in business or even an MBA. I’m excited to explore my options as I progress through my bachelors. </p>

				<article>
					<p>After a series of personal questions about thought processes, social quirks and goals I was labeled as an ‘ISTJ-A’ or ‘Logistician’. According to Myers-Briggs this describes me as practical, dedicated and make decisions based on facts rather than emotions. Allegedly it is common to see such workers in corporate/organisation work places, where spontaneity is abnormal. Within a team environment I believe this would lead me to be an honest, reliable hard worker. Also mentioned in the test I would be more than happy to take on the leader role. Once I have developed a complete understanding of the tasks at hand I love allocating work and making decisions with and for the team. However as the test suggests I do love to play by the rules, this is not always handy in a team where unexpected obstacles appear and improvisation is a necessary component to overcoming. Making it a consideration that when forming a group, having strong improvising, turbulent and/or open-minded coworkers is important. Lastly, the test proposes that I may be stubborn at times with my craving for control, this is a factor that I need to be attentive to all throughout my university and work career as keeping the team positive is crucial.  </p>

					<p>The VARK questionnaire compiled a series of questions that targeted how you prefer/most effectively learn new concepts. I scored an overwhelming 10/10 for Aural learning, this suggests I would much more effectively learn something new through conversation and discussion of said topic. For example having someone who already has a confident understanding of a topic explain it to me is much more approachable than said person writing down instructions (as I only scored a 1 on read/write). I believe this translates well into teamwork.  assuming you can meet up and discuss topics/issues/etc in person, aural learning skills are an asset. Communication within a team is vital and being able to comprehend vital topics from one another is crucial. When forming a team it would be wise to include team members who also accel ataural learning, as I believe if you are able to completely understand a topic from someone you should be able to teach said topic to a similar degree. However it may be clever to include members that accel in other forms of learning to assist broadening everyone's opportunity to succeed.

					<p>The following psychometric test displays various traits similar to those seen in the Myers-Briggs test. Factor 1 describes one extroversion/introversion, individuals who score high on Factor I one are outgoing and social. Individuals who score low tend to be shut-ins. Factor 2 was my highest scoring division, which suggests one's emotional stability. This further cements my position as a ‘logistician’ (Myers-Briggs result). I also scored highly on factor 3’s agreeableness. Where a low score suggests critical and aggressiveness, the results propose I am more positive and open-minded. Factor 4, another high scoring result advocates that I am careful and diligent rather than abrasive or disorganised. Lastly factor 5 displayed a weak score for imagination, suggesting I prefer a conventional/traditional approach to my problems. My high scores for agreeableness, emotional stability and conscientiousness supports my role in a team as a diligent hard worker and/or a leader role.

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>

				<article>
				
					<p>My IT project idea would be to develop an automatic chatbot that aims to assist and guide those towards a path of fitness. Similar to online guides, books, videos, etc on fitness this chatbot would encompass all of those into a simple and discreet chat bot. Taking the form of a mobile application and/or an accessible website, this chatbot aims to take those who are too intimidated by the vast world of fitness and simplify their needs. 
					</p>
				</article>

				<article>
				
					<p>My motivation for this project comes from a personal experience. When I began my fitness journey I was fortunate to have a father that takes fitness very seriously and was more than obliged to help me along every step of my journey. He was there to show me what exercises I could be doing at the gym, what foods I should be eating to supplement my training, as well as breaking down the scientific and practical reasons for everything in between. Fast-forward a year and my roommate wanted to get in shape. He told me this at the start of 2019 and didn’t approach me for help until the end of the year. After I got him started on a simple workout and eating plan he opened up about how intimidating it was for him to get started on his own. He explained how the over abundance of information on the internet was scaring him getting started because he was not sure what would work. Additionally he expressed his embarrassment for coming to me for help, as he assumed it would be easy to figure out what to do. Bringing this to my attention did make me reflect how fortunate I was to have my father's guidance, rather than getting lost in research over keto vs paleo, intermittent fasting vs counting macros, compound lifts vs isolated lifts, etc. If I could condense all my fathers knowledge and counselling into a chatbot then getting started on your fitness journey should be easy and positive for anyone. 
					</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					
					<p>I would want my chatbot to be personalised for each user. I understand everyone's fitness journey absolutely does not start with a scrawny teenage boy looking to bulk up and hop on the gain train. This is why I would press that the chatbot opens the conversation with a simple question regarding the person's goals. This could be as simple as ‘Are you looking to lose or gain weight?’ From here the chatbot can start asking questions about the individuals circumstances (age/weight/height, how often they would be able to train, dietary restrictions). Once all initial questions can be sufficiently answered the chatbot can start developing personalised programs for our users. These programs are to include everything the user may need along their journey, including video tutorials and how to exercise, not just specific exercise movements such as how to squat but everything including how to warm up, gym etiquette, what to expect after workouts, etc. Dietary guides that suggest more than just a macro count, but meal recommendations, eating windows, reminders and importantly I would want the chatbot to be stern like my father was when I was slacking on my diet. The app is designed for beginners however I want the chatbot to be responsive to requests and well. An example of this could be a user asking “I can’t make it to the gym for legs today, what can I do at home?” or “My knee has been giving me hell, what leg exercises do not strain the knee joints?” (I understand the crude wording would probably not work with most chatbots, purely for example). The initial concept could be completed with a simple rule-based chat bot however if it is successful then upgrading to a hybrid that includes NPL (natural language processing), this would allow the bot to converse more naturally with its users. I believe with successful implementation of such a feature would allow the chatbot to expand beyond exercise and dietary needs into the general field of health. Potentially allowing the chatbot to assist users with all sorts of health related inquiries such as specific vitamin/nutrient needs. Proficient programming knowledge and skill would be required to develop such a chatbot. Python can be used to program chatbots as well as introduce neural networks to support natural language processing. If this project was successful I believe a path of fitness would become second nature to thousands more. Improving societies life spans, happiness, productivity and confidence.
